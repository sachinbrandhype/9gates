<h2>How does this service works? </h2>
        
<p>You need to follow few basic steps to place your order. First of all go to our order page and complete the order form. Second step is to make the payment using your credit card or PayPal account. We then assign your work to the professional and this process usually takes less than one working day, but we endeavour to be quicker for more urgent orders. As soon as we complete your order, we will inform you by the mail and send your order in you account, before the deadline. </p>

<h2>How do I know that your work will meet your guarantees? </h2>

<p>First of all, our qualified, experienced English writers undertake your work and are further checked by our Quality Control Team to ensure that it meets our standards and your instructions. As a safeguard, however, you also have a complete satisfaction guarantee - if your work does not meet our promises or your specific instructions we will amend it for you free of charge, as long as you tell us within 7 days. Moreover, all of our writers have a 2:1 degree or higher - and most are post graduates with professional experience. To ensure on-going quality standards, we monitor all researchers to ensure that they continue to produce the level of work that we expect. Please see our application page for more details of our strict recruitment process.</p>

<h2>Why should we choose you over other essay companies?</h2>

<p>In addition to the above, we ensure that your work will never be shared with anyone else. If we fail to deliver the plagiarism free work before the deadline, you can claim your refund. Moreover, we are a company with an international presence. Currently, we are operating in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the USA and we have over 1,000 researchers working for us. We are planning to expand this to different part of the world soon. These factors provide us the advantage over other assignment writing service provider companies. For all these reasons; our company is the most trusted company across the globe, so hand over the burden you have by entrusting us to write you a 100% original answer to your assignment.</p>

<h2>What are the topics your researchers cover?</h2>

<p>Our experts cover everything that you can study - at university, college, school or at any other learning institution. Our pool of researchers is growing every day - and the breadth of problem solving experts is augmenting every day. We can confidently say that there are practically no subject areas that we know of, that we have not helped students with in the past.</p>

<h2>Why this industry is treated as a cheat industry?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, it is very important to understand the intended use of essay writing services provided by the assignment writing companies. Whatever work we supply should never be passed off as the student's own work. It would not be a wise choice for a student to cheat as they would certainly be caught and punished. University tutors experienced eyes can instantly recognise the superior quality of the work a student has bought, just as if they would have copied from a guidebook, and the student who misuses the service still has to face examinations for the majority of their work so how could it ultimately help to use custom writing in this way? This unfortunate assumption made by universities and the media is preventing the honest students from taking advantage freely and openly with academic approval of an invaluable service.</p>

<h2>Is my identity confidential?</h2>

<p>We never reveal that you've used our service unless we're required by law to do so. If you've used our service correctly, in the way we demonstrated above, you need not to be worried.</p>

Our experts have extensive experience and expertise in their respective subjects. If you still want to make sure whether we can complete a particular topic, please contact us through email or live chat.</p>

<p>No. We do not resell our work and each assignment is unique in its content, references, style, pattern and layout.

<h2>Is it ethical to get assignment help?</h2>

<p>See it this way, the market is full with private tutors who provide help in studies. Not all students are born equal and some need more help in academics than others. We aim to help students struggling with part-time jobs or time constraints to achieve academic success.</p>

<h2>You appear for online exams? If yes, how?</h2>

<p>Yes, we do paraphrase assignments. But we do it in a manner that it doesn’t lead to plagiarism.</p>

<h2>Do you also rephrase/paraphrase assignments?</h2>

<p>Yes, we do appear on the candidate’s behalf for online tests. You need to give us the exam details, types of questions — objective, descriptive or multiple choice questions (MCQ), login ID and password; and yes, also some time to prepare. Then on the eve of the exam, you need to make the payment. In case the payment is not received, our writers will not appear for the test.

<h2>Can I pay in parts/installments?</h2>

<p>Yes, payment can be made in parts. However, clients will have to pay 50 percent of the amount in advance; otherwise the writers will not start the work. Once assignment is completed, the client will have to clear the balance to receive the work. </p>

<p>Exceptions can be made for big assignments or bulk orders worth over 400 USD. Clients can then make the payment in 3-4 installments. But in that case too, we will not do the whole work; rather do it in parts. For instance, if the client pays 100 out of 400 USD, we will do 25 percent of the work and then wait for the next installment to resume 
the task.</p>
